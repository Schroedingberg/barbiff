   This is the 'inclusive' version of take-while - it includes the element that matches.
   Surprisingly not in clojure.core, but it's a common utility in many projects.
   
   Example:
     (take-until #(= 3 %) [1 2 3 4 5]) => (1 2 3)

  ;; DESIGN DECISION: Lazy recursion vs eager reduce
  ;; ================================================
  ;;
  ;; This implementation uses lazy-seq recursion (~50 LOC).
  ;; Alternative: projection.clj uses eager reduce (~90 LOC).
  ;;
  ;; Why lazy-seq wins for this use case:
  ;; 
  ;; 1. Mental model: "Find start, take until end, recurse" 
  ;;    vs "Accumulate sections while tracking current" (state machine)
  ;;
  ;; 2. Simplicity: No explicit state, classic functional pattern
  ;;    Can inspect intermediate results at each step
  ;;
  ;; 3. Tradeoffs: Slightly slower for huge logs (millions of events)
  ;;    but negligible for real workout logs (hundreds of events)
  ;;
  ;; Recommendation: Use this approach unless profiling shows otherwise.
  ;; "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" - start here.
  ;;
  ;; See git history or projection.clj for the reduce-based alternative.
